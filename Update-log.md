# 100 Days Of Code - Log
### R1 Day 1: May 17, 2019 Friday

**Today's Progress**: I've gone through many exercises on FreeCodeCamp and tutorials on Reactjs.

**Thoughts** I've recently started learning Reactjs, and I just love. So far I have covered State and Props, 
Components(Both Functional and classes),and routing. I have built two projects as well ff NetNinja tutorials on Youtube.I did the work again and had
this error:"expected assignment or function call no unused-expressions reactjs " putting all the projects into one main project. Hope to solve it soon
