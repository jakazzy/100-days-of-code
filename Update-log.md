# 100 Days Of Code - Log
### R1 Day 1: May 17, 2019 Friday

**Today's Progress**: I've gone through many exercises on FreeCodeCamp and tutorials on Reactjs.

**Thoughts** I've recently started learning Reactjs, and I just love. So far I have covered State and Props, 
Components(Both Functional and classes),and routing. I have built two projects as well ff NetNinja tutorials on Youtube.I did the work again and had
this error:"expected assignment or function call no unused-expressions reactjs " putting all the projects into one main project. Hope to solve it soon

### R1 Day 2: May 20, 2019 Friday(missed recording yesterday's)

**Today's Progress**: I've built a note taking app using Reactjs. Currently built the ability to Create and Read features of the application

**Thoughts** I love Reactjs struggled a  bit generating ID 's after a new note is created. fixed it using the index generated from iterating using maps.

## R1 Day 3: May 22, 2019 Wednesday

**Today's Progress**: After strugling with this day's unending, I have finally completed the three features of the simple note taking app using Reactjs.The features are edit note, create a card and save a note after creating, a card or editing one and delete a card. All these working using just memory.Hope to persist data in localStorage subsequently. 

**Thoughts** Sometimes you need assistance to overcome some hurdles. Be persistent. It is possible

## R1 Day 4: May 23, 2019 Thursday

**Today's Progress**: Today was awesome. I was busy for most part of the day but i got to create a responsive web application using HTML and CSS. It was really fun. I am not done. I hope to complete the desktop version and review react today. I also got an accountability partner today. Yeah it was fun 

**Thoughts**: Face challenges logically than emotionally. It gets easier by the day. Be persistent. It is possible

## R1 Day 5: May 24, 2019 Friday

**Today's Progress**: Completed the desktop version for Fylo landing page, created a typewriter-like function in JavaScript.  For most part of the day i felt quite tired. 

**Thoughts**: Face challenges logically than emotionally. state just three goals to be completed each day and stick to it. Put pressure on yourself to get it done.
